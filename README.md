# object_oriented_programming_assignment2

This project is a javaFx project that is serializing a list of cars. 
This project was for an object oriented programming module from the begining of last semester.

We were supposed to show heap dumps from visualVM of outOfMemoryExceptions and other things.
I think it may be importing a jar from a different project so it may not run your machine.
